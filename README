# Angular 15 Standalone with Vite 3 and crazy speed

all is Vite and Angular, tailwind if you like. That all to start a new journey


To support selector matching, the Angular compiler needs to maintain a dependency graph between your components which requires a different compilation model than Vite.

You can give Vite + esbuild a try by updating your angular.json:

``` 

...
"architect": {
  "build": {                     /* Add the esbuild suffix  */
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild",
...


```
